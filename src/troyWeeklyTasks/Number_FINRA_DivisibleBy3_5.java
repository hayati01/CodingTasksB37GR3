    Write a function which prints out the numbers from 1 to 30 but
    for numbers which are a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the number
    and for numbers which are a multiple of 5, print "RA" instead of the number.
    for numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FINRA" instead of the number.

    EX:
    1 2 FIN 4 RA FIN 7 8 FIN RA 11 FIN 13 14 FINRA 16 17 FIN 19 RA FIN 22 23 FIN RA 26 FIN 28 29 FINRA
